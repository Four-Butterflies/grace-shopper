      <p>
        Four Butterflies is a collective of programmers who set out to create
        the single best, react-based, vinyl ecommerce site ever submitted to
        Fullstack Academy's Grace Shopper capstone project.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you look in the README on Github for this project, this will become
        extremely evident.
      </p>
      <p>
        We love ecommerce, and we love music. The choice was obvious for us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We hope it is just as obvious to you that you should spend your time
        browsing this site and your money on some albums here{' '}
